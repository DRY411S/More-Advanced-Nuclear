# More-Advanced-Nuclear
A factorio mod that allows more powerful nuclear plants to be built, saving space and reducing UPS

This mod is based on Advanced Nuclear by Hopewell, which is no longer maintained, and contains bugs so that it can generate only a maximum of 4x the vanilla Nuclear entities.

Updated, and ownership transferred to DRY411S by kind permission of Hopewell
